We are just launching our partners initiative where we will be working closely with fellow incubators, accelerators and other bodies to support their innovation practices. We have refined our program at our sister organisation, [Jaaga Startup](http://jaagastartup.in), over the last 2 yearsand look forward to working closely with you too.

## Please write to us at info@jaagasustain.in if interested.
