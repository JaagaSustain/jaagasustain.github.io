We have worked on 30+ products in the domains of sustainable engineering and efficient communications. Here's a partial list of the successful ones. Buy us a beer to learn more. Buy us two and we can talk about the less successful attempts!

_NB: We respect confidentiality and take it seriously._

Wireless communication
----------------------
- UHF RFID tag that actually works on animals
- Passive, wireless pressure sensors for vacuum monitoring
- [openSAFETY](http://www.open-safety.org/) enabled long range communication for safety critical applications
- [Seamless connectivity to new WiFi networks](https://github.com/tejpochiraju/connectOn)
- Intelligent, configurable wireless router for industrial IoT applications
- Ultra-wideband and tunable components such as amplifiers, couplers, antennas
- [Impedance tuners](https://github.com/micrograce/impedanceTuner)

Microwave processing
--------------------
- [Microwave leakage detector](https://github.com/micrograce/microwaveDetector)
- High intensity drying for paper products
- Highly efficient, single station polymer moulding for the apparel industry
- Rapid flood remediation unit with built-in safety features
- Pre-heating for thermoformers
- Focused heating for wet spot removal in insulating materials
