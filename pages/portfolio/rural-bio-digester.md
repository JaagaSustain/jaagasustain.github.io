## Incubatee
![Sustain Earth]({{ site.urlimg }}sustainearth-logo.png)

### Project scope
Develop means of measuring gas output from bio-digester so that monetisation can be based on gas usage rather than sales of bio-digester.

### Project Innovations
- We trained and worked closely with a Sustain Earth intern to develop a timer run on the same power circuit as the bio-digester
- The total run-time is recorded weekly by an operator via a custom app over a password protected wireless access point hosted by the sensor
- The total cost of sensor, power circuitry and housing is < Rs. 400

### Status
- Four sensors are being deployed with bio-digesters in the north of India
- The entire sensor development has been released as open source
