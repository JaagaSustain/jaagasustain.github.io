### Project scope
[Texon](http://texon.com) manufacture and supply structural components to the shoe industry globally. We were tasked with developing the next evolution of back-part moulding in shoe manufacturing. This process which is critical in defining the shape of the shoe needs precise thermal control and uniform heating.

### Project Innovations
- We designed and implemented a prototype microwave backpart moulder that reduces energy consumption by 70%, time needed per shoe by 80% and reduces the moulding process to a single station ([patent filed](http://www.google.com/patents/WO2015075435A1))
- We developed a novel material that is ideally suited to the microwave backpart moulding process ([patent filed](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2015075436A1))

### Status
- We delivered the prototype moulder and all material formulations in mid-2014
