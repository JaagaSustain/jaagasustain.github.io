### Project scope
Implement a microwave drying system to completely dry 40 recycled paper bottles a minute. Each injection moulded bottle has 50g of paper and 100g of water before drying. Post drying this reduces to around 4g of water. The alternatives to microwave drying - traditional convective heaters and passive drying via storage - take anywhere from 20 minutes to 12 hours.

### Project Innovations
- We created a high microwave density tunnel system that efficiently and rapidly vapourises up to 4L of water a minute.
- Working closely with NiBek, and leveraging their significant experience with ceramic kilns, we implemented a continuous microwave system using a 2-door approach at entry and exit.
- We combined industrial power supplies with domestic magnetrons to create a first of its kind, low-cost, easy to maintain system with a 'magnetrons as light bulbs' approach.

### Status
- Two of these systems have been sold to multinational brands in UK and Switzerland.
- We are partnering with NiBek to evaluate application of such systems in other areas such as food processing.
